# Expense Tracker

## Overview

An app that helps people track their expenses, and manage spending habits. 

## Problem Statement

- A frustrating part about tracking expenses is how tedious it can be.

- Current solutions to tracking expenses fall short because they require lots of organization and work, things like saving receipts or constantly watching your bank statements, etc.

- Taking the tedious nature out of expense tracking, and streamlining it in a way where a user can get all their information about their expenses and set specific goals they want to achieve.

## Target Users

Parents, Students, Young Adults

- [ A.I. chatbox assistant to help with budgeting advice ] 
- [ Budgeting streaks (e.g. snapchat streaks but instead of sending snaps it would be for how many months/days you've reached your budget goal) ]
